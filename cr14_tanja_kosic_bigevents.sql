Likewise outstanding are the exquisite works by Rudolf von Alt from his over 70-year career. His masterful watercolours run from the Biedermeier era all the way to the rise of the Secession movement around 1900.This exhibition presents a veritable parade of exceptionally beautiful pictures, including the Albertinaï¿½s own treasures as well as important loan works, all of which pay impressive tribute to the high standing of the Viennese watercolour in the context of 19th century art.', 'https://events.wien.info/media/full/schuetz.jpg', 'http://www.germaniainternational.com/Images4/AuthenticHitlerOilPaintingChurch-01.jpg', 500, 'info@albertina.at', '43163589', 'Albertina ', 'Albertinaplatz 1 | 1010 Vienna', 'https://events.wien.info/en/tcq/the-art-of-viennese-watercolour/', 'Art', '<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2659.0995101949784!2d16.36599371565135!3d48.204699179228776!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x476d079bf27e5ac1%3A0x66ef8a989f37deb8!2sAlbertina!5e0!3m2!1sde!2sat!4v1520689551924\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>'),

The zither on which Anton Karas played the score for silver screen classic The Third Man is another of the attractions.\r\n\r\nRhythm, beat, sound, melody – the ingredients that make up music trigger make themselves felt in every sense of the word. Such as when clubbers feel the deep bass sounds run through their bodies on a night out. Dancing like there is no tomorrow is all the rage at the capital’s discos, clubs and festivals. But dance partners can also tune in to the music on a different level at Viennese balls where the waltz, foxtrot, jive and samba set the scene.
